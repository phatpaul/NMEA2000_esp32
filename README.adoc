= NMEA2000_esp32 library for ESP32 boards =

Inherited object for use NMEA2000 library for ESP32 Boards.
See also https://github.com/ttlappalainen/NMEA2000[NMEA2000] library.

To use this library, you will also need NMEA2000 library.

The library defines as default Tx pin to GPIO 16 and Rx pint to GPIO 4. You can 
change these with defines:

  #define ESP32_CAN_TX_PIN GPIO_NUM_16
  #define ESP32_CAN_RX_PIN GPIO_NUM_4

before including NMEA2000_CAN.h or NMEA2000_esp32.h

== Compatibility ==

This library has been tested for compatibility with these targets and build environments:

[cols="2,1,1,1,1,1"]
|===
|Support |ESP32 |ESP32-C2 |ESP32-C3 |ESP32-S2 |ESP32-S3

(PlatformIO is supported but isn't included in this table because it can be configured to use either Arduino-ESP32 or ESP-IDF)

== Thanks ==

Thanks to Thomas Barth, barth-dev.de for his implementation of
ESP32 CAN driver. Instead of using his driver as external driver
I implemented the code to the NMEA2000_esp32 to avoid conflicts.

== Changes ==

2023-05-23 - add ESP-IDF v5 support

04.10.2022
- Add ESP-IDF support

15.11.2020
- Added CAN reset to CAN_init
- Fix for ESP32 rev>=2. New chips uses Baud Rate Prescaler Divider (BRP_DIV) bit, which was set on
  interrupt vector causing invalid baud rate.

05.11.2019
- Fixed can frame buffer handling. After ESP soft reset can controller could have false data on
  frame length and cause writing outside of frame buffer.

20.10.2019
- Fixed pin definition at startup to avoid error frame.

06.04.2014 Initial commit.
